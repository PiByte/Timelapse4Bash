# Timelapse4Bash
Timelapse4Bash is a simple timelapsing tool that takes screenshots and then converts them over to a movieclip
*Note:* This crappy script is full of bugs, so keep that in mind when downloading this!

### Usage
```sh
$ cd ./timelapse.sh [Interval between frames] [Amount of frames] [Framerate of final clip] [Name of clip]
```

### Installation
Download it, make a special folder and put it there, run it. That's it! :)
